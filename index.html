      Firefox 4 Beta User Interface Study
    </h1>
    <p>
    We present a visualization study of the interactions users have with Firefox 4 Beta UI 
    components. This study provides an insight on how accessible these components are. We try to answer 
    questions like: How frequently are these components being accessed? 
    What are the main UI interaction differences between experienced and non-experienced Firefox users? 
    How UI interactions change for people accessing Firefox from their Homes, Work, School or Mobile devices?
    </p>
    <p>
    The main visualization is based on a Squarified TreeMap layout where each rectangle represents a UI component. 
    The area of each rectangle is proportional to the number of times a UI component has been accessed; 
    the color of each rectangle varies from red (beginners) to blue (advanced/power users).
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        A TreeMap layout of FF 4 beta UI Components. The area of the rectangles is proportional to the number 
        of times the UI component was accessed. The color of each rectangle is proportional to the skill users accessing 
        this UI component have with computers.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    Hovering each rectangle of the TreeMap shows a tooltip with information about how frequently accessed that component is 
    and also about the average skill level of the users accessing it.
   </p>

      <figcaption>
        Hovering the Navigation Toolbar component shows a tooltip with information about its access.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    Left clicking on a rectangle sets the focus on that UI component group, right clicking on the visualization 
    brings the user back to the previous level of the hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
    We understand that making an average of the users' skills, although interesting for an overview, can lead to incorrect results. 
    We solve this problem by adding a pie chart visualization that shows how users skills are distributed for a UI component.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/treemap3.png" alt="Drilling down enables a pie chart view for each UI component" />
      <figcaption>
        Drilling down enables a pie chart view for each UI component. Left and right click are used to either drill down or go back a level.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    We also provide dynamic filtering based on different criteria such as the user experience with using Firefox, the 
    user location when browsing the Web and whether the user browses the Web with other browsers besides Firefox. This dynamic 
    filtering provides insights on how to make Firefox more accessible to different types of users. Also, the smooth animations 
    provide an easy way to compare the main usage differences across categories of users. You can trigger these 
    filters by clicking on the top buttons.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="img/buttons.png" alt="Filter Options" style="margin:0 100px;" />
      <figcaption>
      The user can filter by Time using Firefox, Location where Firefox is used and whether the users are exclusive FF users 
      or not. Clicking on these filters will trigger smooth morphing animations.
